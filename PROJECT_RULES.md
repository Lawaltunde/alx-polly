# Project Rules and Development Patterns

These high-level rules guide all development in this project to ensure quality, security, and maintainability.

## 1. User-Centric & Secure
All settings features must prioritize user experience, accessibility, and data securityâ€”especially for authentication, profile, and account management.

## 2. Type-Safe & Validated
All user input will be strictly validated (using Zod or similar) and handled with TypeScript for type safety and reliability.

## 3. Modular & Maintainable
Code will be organized into clear, reusable modules (UI, server actions, Supabase helpers) to support easy scaling and future enhancements.

## 4. Server Actions for Sensitive Ops
All sensitive operations (profile updates, password changes, account deletion) will use server actions to ensure security and proper session handling.

## 5. Feedback & Error Handling
Every user action will provide clear feedback (success, error, loading), and all errors will be handled gracefully both in the UI and backend.

These rules must be followed for all new features and refactors. Update this file if project goals or architecture change.
