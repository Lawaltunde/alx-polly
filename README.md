# Project Extension Plan â€“ Polly-App

I will be extending the current Polly-App project. This is a full-stack web application built with a modern tech stack, featuring a Next.js and TypeScript frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling, Supabase for the backend and database, and Vitest for testing.

## Planned Features

Below are the new features I will be adding. At the end, the application will be well-tested, fully functional, and responsive:

- ðŸ”’ User role management (e.g., admin vs. regular users)
- ðŸ“Š Poll result charts (using a charting library)
- ðŸ“± Mobile responsiveness and improved accessibility
- ðŸ§ª Unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- ðŸ§  AI-powered reviews and automated release notes with CodeRabbit
- ðŸ“· QR code generation for individual polls, making them easily shareable across devices

### Stretch Goals (if time permits)

- ðŸ“¦ Integrate an email notification system (e.g., poll closing alerts)
- ðŸ’¬ Add comments or discussion threads on each poll

## AI Integration Plan

I will use AI agents such as Cursor, Trae, and Copilot for:

- Scaffolding new features
- Function and schema suggestions
- Unit and integration test generation
- Database schema design
- Documentation drafting and enhancement
- Refactoring and code optimization
- Continuous learning (asking AI for explanations of its suggestions)

All commits will be reviewed with CodeRabbit, and fixes will be made with AI assistance.
Docstrings will be written by me and refined by the AI agent. A mix of inline and prompt-based interactions will be used.

## Code & Feature Generation Strategy

Since the project is already scaffolded for future expansion, I will first provide the AI agent with a clear understanding of the codebase and the specific features to be added. This reduces hallucinations and ensures relevant suggestions.

I will also define rules to prevent existing logic from being altered unintentionally.
Every prompt will be concise, and all AI-generated suggestions will be manually reviewed before implementation.

## Prompting Strategy

When prompting the AI agent, I will take the perspective of a senior developer responsible for extending this project. The agent will:

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase.
- Extend the current scaffold to include new features such as:
    - ðŸ”’ User role management
    - ðŸ“Š Poll result charts
    - ðŸ“± Mobile responsiveness and accessibility improvements
    - ðŸ§ª Testing enhancements
    - ðŸ§  AI-powered reviews
    - ðŸ“· QR code generation
- If any of these features conflict with or hinder the functionality of the project, the AI agent should flag them during the planning stage before code generation begins.

# Polly - A Real-Time Polling Application

Polly is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, manage, and vote on polls in real-time. It is built with modern web technologies to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Project Overview

This application is designed to be a real-time polling system where users can sign up, log in, and participate in polls. The key features include:

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login functionality.
- **Poll Management**: Create, update, and delete polls.
- **Real-Time Voting**: Vote on polls and see the results update live.
- **User Dashboard**: View and manage your polls.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (v14+)
- **Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) (PostgreSQL)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **Testing**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

## Setup and Installation

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-polly.git
cd alx-polly
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase

1.  **Create a Supabase Project**: Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) and create a new project.
2.  **Database Schema**: In the Supabase SQL Editor, run the schema from `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` to set up the necessary tables and policies.
3.  **Get API Keys**: In your Supabase project settings, find your **Project URL** and **anon key**.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

## How to Run the App

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Poll

1.  Log in to your account.
2.  Navigate to the **Polls** page from the user menu.
3.  Click the **Create Poll** button.
4.  Fill in the poll question and options, then submit.

### Voting on a Poll

1.  From the main dashboard, click on any poll to view it.
2.  Select an option and click the **Vote** button.
3.  The poll results will update in real-time.

## Running Tests

This project uses Vitest for testing. To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run all the tests and provide a summary of the results.
